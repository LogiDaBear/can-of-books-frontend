# Start your own "Can of Books" App

This repository has starter code to begin work on creating your own online bookshelf.

## What can books do?

Books are life-changing. They have the power to enlighten, educate, entertain, heal, and help us grow. Build out this code base to create an web app to track what books have impacted you, and what's recommended to read next.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  5. How can you best utilize these strengths in the development of your application?

  6. In what areas do you each want to develop greater strength?
  
  - Organization for Logan and for Ryan- hands down.
  
  7. Knowing that every person in your team needs to understand the code, how do you plan to approach the day-to-day development?
  
  - We talk about it before we start and show eachother our lines of code and discuss them as we go.

## Conflict Resolution
  8. What will your team do if one person is pulling all the weight while the other person is not contributing?
  - Talk about it and come up with a plan
  9. What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other member contribute?
  - Talk about it and come up with a plan
  10. How will you approach each other and the challenge of building an application knowing that it is impossible for two people to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level?
  - We explain to eachother with what we are implementing line by line or what we are working on at the time. Using VS LiveShare is a game changer.
